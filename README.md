[Go to App](https://mighty-atoll-73138.herokuapp.com)

## Concept
A burger-themed recipe app. You are able to add a burger and 3 toppings. Clicking the `Devour` button moves the burger to a different section of the app, where it can then be removed from the db.

## Technology
* Client-side rendering is handled by `React.js`.
* Single Page App (SPA) with conditional rendering for `user` profiles and `burger` state.
* `mySQL` database.
* `Express.js` for API endpoints.
* `Passport.js` for authentication

## Guest Login
* username: `"guest"`
